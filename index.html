        <p>Hi there! I'm a former registered nurse and medical case manager turned entrepreneur and self-taught web developer. 
            I always loved writing, creating, and building things, which is why I left nursing to pursue web development. 
            With over 85% of the US population owning a smartphone and 95% having internet access, the world is moving online, 
            and web development is becoming more important every day. Not only does it let me cater to my love of creating things, 
            but it also allows me to help others by making beautiful, on-brand websites for them.</p>

        <p> My strong nursing background has taught me the value of quality customer service and client-centered communication, 
            which I bring to all my business relationships and client interactions. I'm also experienced in freelance digital marketing, 
            social media management, and video and image-based content creation. In 2022, I started Acuworld System, a white-label software 
            service that helps local businesses automate their marketing, thrive online, and appear amazingly attractive to prospects and customers.</p>
            
        <p> When I'm not working on web development or marketing projects, you can find me filming cooking videos for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LifeWithYen">Youtube 
            channel</a>, exploring new food products from Sayweee online groceries and <a href="https://www.sayweee.com/en/account/profile/10900338">creating video content</a>, or walking my elderly dog at the nearby nature trails. 
            Let's connect and see how I can help bring your brand to life!</p>
