        <p>Hi there! I'm a former registered nurse turned entrepreneur and self-taught web developer. 
            I have always loved writing and building things which is why I left nursing for more creative pursuits.
            In 2022, I started to dabble in freelance digital marketing, social media management, and video and image-based content creation.</p>
            
        <p> When I'm not working on web development or marketing projects, you can find me filming cooking videos for my (relatively new) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LifeWithYen">Youtube 
            channel</a>, exploring food products from Sayweee online groceries and <a href="https://www.sayweee.com/en/account/profile/10900338">creating video content for them</a>, or walking my elderly dog at the nearby nature trails. 
            Let's connect and see how we can collaborate!</p>
